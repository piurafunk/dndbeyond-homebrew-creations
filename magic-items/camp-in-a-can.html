    This cylinder has several bands circling it, each with different runes, a crystalline lens on one end, and a small
    metal plate that can be pressed on the other end.
</p>
<p>
    The bands correspond to articles of a wilderness camp site, and the runes on each band correspond to the particular
    quality or functionality of that article. For example, one band refers to fires, or sources of warmth and light. One
    rune corresponds to a simple campfire, while the next rune may be a cooking fire, complete with cooking spit,
    hanging pot, rotating grill plate, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Conjuring the different articles requires a fuel source. The fuel can be inserted by unscrewing the rear of the
    cylinder. At the DM's discretion, this may be a generic quantity of magical materials, expressed in gold pieces
    (gp). In Eberron, this might be Dragonshards. In Exandria, this may be Residuum.
</p>
<p>
    Conjuring the article consumes the specified quantity of fuel, expressed in gold pieces (gp). If not enough fuel is
    present for the selected article, it does nothing (some groups may find it fun to have a random article conjured
    when there is not enough fuel, either from the chosen band, or from a random band for full spontaneity).
